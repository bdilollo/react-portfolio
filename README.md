## Description
This repo contains an application that represents the rough outline of a portfolio. It utilizes React to dynamically update and render elements on the page. It contains several different elements, including About, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume pages. The form to submit a message on the Contact page utilizes React state values to dynamically track and update form fields, and alerts the user when unsatisfactory values have been inputted.
